This is an 8-bit virtual processor designed for a DE0-Nano Cyclone IV FPGA device

Warning: This project has not been implemented on a physical DE0-Nano Cyclone IV since Spring 2016. The PIN layout may not be correct for the current generation of DE0-Nano's, as well as other discrepencies.

Notice: This project is based off of the final project in Brock LaMeres's "Introduction to Logic Circuits and Logic Design with VHDL" text book.
